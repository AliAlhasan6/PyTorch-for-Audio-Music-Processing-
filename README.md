# PyTorch-for-Audio-Music-Processing-
using Torch Audio to perform effective audio feature extraction on GPU and PyTorch to build your Deep Learning models
Steps:
First : build an auto encoder that can train on pre-processed data.
Second, Try to loop the pre-processing voice data logarithm that constarcts the log mel spectrum on a data set using IO library.
Third : try to use the extracted log mel spectrums in the auto encoder
Forth: try to do it with arabic langague voice recorder .
